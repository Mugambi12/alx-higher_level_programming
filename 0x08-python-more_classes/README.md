## 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

### Description
This repository contains Python programs and scripts created for the Holberton School 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects project. The project focuses on advanced topics related to object-oriented programming in Python, including:
- class methods
- static methods
- properties
- class attributes
- special methods.


### Requirements
- All Python files were created and tested on Ubuntu 20.04
- All scripts are written in Python 3.8.5
- All files are executable
- The code adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines (pycodestyle version 2.8.*)

### Usage
To run the scripts, you can use the following command:

```python
  ./<filename.py>
```
Replace <filename.py> with the name of the script you want to execute.
