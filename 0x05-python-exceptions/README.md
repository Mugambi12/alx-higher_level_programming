# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

Python project that includes solutions to various questions related to Python exceptions.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- The difference between errors and exceptions
- What exceptions are and how to use them
- When to use exceptions
- How to correctly handle an exception
- The purpose of catching exceptions
- How to raise a built-in exception
- When to implement a clean-up action after an exception

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory
- Code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) style
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
