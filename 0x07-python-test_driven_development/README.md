## Concepts
* Never forget a test

## Background Context
In this project, the focus is on test-driven development (TDD) in Python programming. The project emphasizes writing tests and documentation before writing the actual code. The intranet checks for Python projects will not be released before the first deadline, allowing for a stronger focus on TDD and considering all possible edge cases. It is encouraged to work together on test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage.

## Resources
Read or watch:
* [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) (until "26.2.3.7. Warnings" included)
* [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://pymotw.com/3/doctest/index.html)
* [Unit Tests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tNS--WetLI)
* [Unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
* [Interactive and Non-interactive tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#interactive-and-non-interactive-tests)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What an interactive test is
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*) style
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* You have to use the unittest module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
* All your test files and folders should start by test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for task 0, the tests folder should contain a file tests/test\_0.py
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test\_0.py
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don't miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!

## Tasks
### Task 0: Integers addition
Write a function that adds 2 integers.

### Task 1: Divide a matrix
Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.

### Task 2: Say my name
Write a function that prints "My name is " followed by the first and last name.

### Task 3: Print square
Write a function that prints a square with the character `#`.

### Task 4: Text indentation
Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: `.`, `?`, and `:`.

### Task 5: Max integer - Unittest
Write a function `def max_integer(list=[]):` that finds the biggest integer of a list.

### Task 6: Matrix multiplication
Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices.

### Task 7: Lazy matrix multiplication
Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module `NumPy`

### Task 8: CPython #3: Python Strings
Create a function that prints Python strings.
